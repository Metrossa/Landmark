# Landmark Recognition App

**Landmark Recognition App** is an Android application that uses a TensorFlow Lite (TFLITE) model to recognize landmarks in real-time through the device's camera. Simply point your camera at a landmark, and the app will provide its name and relevant details.

## Features
- **Real-time Landmark Recognition**: Uses TFLITE model for quick and efficient landmark identification.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for seamless interactions.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Designed for optimal performance on Android devices.

## How It Works
1. **Model**: The app integrates a pre-trained TFLITE model for landmark recognition.
2. **Camera Access**: Captures live camera feed to identify landmarks.
3. **Results Display**: Recognized landmarks are displayed on the screen with their names and potentially additional information.

## Requirements
- Android 8.0 (API level 26) or above
- Camera permissions
- TensorFlow Lite model file (`model.tflite`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/landmark-recognition-app.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.
4. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage
1. Install and open the app on your Android device.
2. Point your camera at a landmark.
3. The app will display the recognized landmark's name.

## Customization
You can replace the default TFLITE model with your own:
1. Place your `.tflite` model file in the `assets` folder.
2. Update the model input and output dimensions in the code, if required.
